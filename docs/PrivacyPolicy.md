# Moment365 — Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: March 20, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Moment365** (the “App”). Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use the App.

## 2. Data Collection

- **Event Data**: We store event titles, dates, reminders, and any notes you provide. This data is used exclusively to display countdowns and notifications.
- **iCloud Sync (Optional)**: If you enable iCloud sync, event data is transmitted to Apple’s servers. Apple’s own privacy policy applies to iCloud storage. We do not directly store or track your Apple ID credentials.
- **Body & Surroundings Data (New)**:
  - We currently **do not** collect body or surroundings sensor data (e.g., from cameras, microphones, or motion sensors). If that changes, we will update this policy.
- **Analytics**: We may use anonymous, aggregated analytics to improve the App’s features and performance. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected for analytics.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

- **Countdown & Reminders**: The App uses your event data to set up local or iCloud-based reminders, notifications, and countdown displays.
- **Syncing**: When iCloud sync is enabled, data is shared across your Apple devices via iCloud.
- **User Privacy Choices**: If you wish to disable iCloud sync, you can do so at any time in the App’s **Settings**.

## 4. Data Sharing

- **Third Parties**: We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
- **Service Providers**: We rely on Apple’s iCloud services for optional data synchronization. We do not have access to your Apple ID credentials or personal iCloud account beyond the event data you choose to sync.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system is 100% secure. Use the App at your own discretion.

## 6. Your Choices

- **Opt Out of Sync**: If you do not wish to sync data to iCloud, leave the iCloud sync disabled in the App’s **Settings**.
- **Delete Events**: You may delete your events at any time; deleted events are removed from both your device’s local storage and iCloud (if sync is enabled).

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Moment365 is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a minor has used our App and provided personal data, please contact us so we can remove that information.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our data practices. If we make significant changes, we will post a notice within the App or on our website prior to the update becoming effective.
