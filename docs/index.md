## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: How do I enable iCloud Sync?**  
A: Within the app, open **Settings** → **Toggle “Enable iCloud Sync”**. Once enabled, your events safely sync across all your devices. You can also “Pull to Refresh” in the main view to force a manual merge of local vs. remote changes.

**Q2: What if I'm offline?**  
A: Moment365 queues your event changes. Once you’re back online, it automatically retries uploading or merging changes with iCloud.

**Q3: How do I contact support?**  
A: Submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/logreg-n-coffee/moment365.com/issues) or use the in-app contact link. We’ll be happy to help!
