# Moment365 — Introduction

Welcome to **Moment365**, the intuitive countdown and reminders app that helps you organize, track, and celebrate life’s biggest (and smallest) moments. From birthdays and deadlines to all-day events and cross-timezone scheduling, Moment365 has you covered.

## Features

- **CountDown & Reminders**Track upcoming events (or tasks) with precise countdowns. Set custom reminders “X days before” or “days after” to never miss a milestone.
- **Time-Zoned & All-Day Events**Effortlessly schedule events across multiple time zones, or mark them as all-day for simpler daily reminders.
- **iCloud Sync & Conflict Resolution**Safely store events in iCloud, with robust offline logic and a “lastModified” approach for merging. No more confusion if you edit from multiple devices.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**Simply swipe down in the app to sync with iCloud. Local changes are pushed if they’re newer, remote changes are pulled if they’re fresher.
- **Favorites & Search**
  Quickly locate priority events by marking them as favorite, or filter them via the built-in search bar.

## Getting Started

1. **Install** Moment365 on your iOS device (iOS 18+ recommended).
2. **Launch** the app and add your first event.
3. **Enable iCloud Sync** (optional) in Settings if you’d like to keep your events up to date across multiple devices.
4. **Swipe down** to refresh and merge changes from iCloud.
